# harness-adapter-pi

Load this skill after `harness-adapters` when the resolved harness is `pi` or `pi-signed`.
## pi and pi-signed (VERIFIED 2026-07-27)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | The Firstmate-owned extension's `agent_start` (busy) and `agent_settled` confirmed by `ctx.isIdle()` (idle), which covers retries, compaction, tool loops, and queued continuations. |
| Exit command | `/quit` |
| Interrupt | single Escape |

Pi has no permission system, so crewmates are always autonomous.
Pi's `packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md` UI and display section documents `regular` as the `tuiMode` default and `fullscreen` as experimental; fullscreen can bury steers by rewriting scrollback, so Firstmate avoids it when the installed CLI supports the override.
`fm-spawn.sh --help` owns the executable-pinning and version-safe launch mechanics.
`pi-signed` is the signed wrapper identity verified on version 0.82.0 and exposes the same CLI and TUI behavior as Pi.
Firstmate records `pi-signed` without normalization and refuses rather than falling back to `pi` when that wrapper is unavailable.
The observed signed process tree is an exact `pi-signed` wrapper parent with the Pi application as its child, while tmux reports the foreground command as the exact `pi-launcher` name for both selected executables.
The installed plain `pi` command also execs that signed launcher, so `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi-signed` is the authoritative selection marker and shared unmarked ancestry remains `pi`.
Firstmate sets `FM_PI_HARNESS` explicitly for both worker launch identities, and a signed primary uses the README launch command to establish the same boundary.
Keep the brief as one positional argument.
Multiple positional args become separate queued messages; `fm-spawn`'s template already does this correctly.

Project trust dialog can appear on the first pi run in any not-yet-trusted directory, observed even on clean worktrees.
Accept with Enter.
The decision persists per path in `~/.pi/agent/trust.json`, so later spawns in the same worktree slot skip it.

`fm-spawn` keeps the turn-end extension in `state/`, outside the worktree, because project-local extension files make the trust gate strictly worse and pollute the project.
The extension must listen for pi's `turn_end` event, not `agent_end`, so the watcher wakes after each completed turn instead of only when the whole agent run exits.
Pi sets `PI_CODING_AGENT=true` for its children; this is its harness-detection env marker.

**Primary-session guard fact (verified 2026-07-09, Pi 0.80.5).**
The firstmate PRIMARY's own `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` listens for logical-run `agent_settled`, not per-tool-loop `turn_end`, and uses `pi.sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })` to force one guarded follow-up when `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` returns 2.
Without `deliverAs: "followUp"`, Pi rejects the send while the agent is still processing.
Pi's primary watcher protocol also requires the tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` extension, same trust-once discovery as the turn-end guard.
The model arms through `fm_watch_arm_pi`, never a foreground bash arm; the watcher tool result and clean-exit fallback are owned by `docs/supervision-protocols/pi.md`.
`bin/fm-session-start.sh` reports when the live Pi-family session has not loaded both the turn-end guard and watcher extensions, and points at the selected executable after project trust as the fix, with `-e` as a trust-free fallback.
When a secondmate is launched on Pi or pi-signed, `fm-spawn.sh --secondmate` launches the selected executable with both `-e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts` and `-e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts`, both already present in the secondmate home's git worktree.
