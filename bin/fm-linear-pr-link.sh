# Append a Linear reference to a task's pull request so Linear links the two.
#
# Called by fm-pr-check.sh the moment a task's PR is reported, and safe to run by
# hand afterwards. Linear links a PR to an issue by branch name, by PR TITLE, or
# by a magic word plus the issue ID in the PR DESCRIPTION (verified against
# Linear's GitHub docs, 2026-08-02 - see docs/linear.md for the evidence).
# firstmate's branches are fm/<task-id>, which can never match Linear's own
# branch convention, so the PR body is the hook.
#
# Usage: fm-linear-pr-link.sh <task-id> <pr-url>
#
# CONTRACT: this NEVER fails a PR check. Every path - unconfigured, unreachable,
# unauthenticated, slow, no mirrored issue, gh refusing the edit - prints one line
# saying what did happen and exits 0. "No mirrored issue" can occur before the
# first refresh or for work added since the latest refresh, and is reported, not
# treated as an error.
#
# The body edit is strictly additive: the existing body is copied byte-for-byte
# and the reference block appended after it, then the result is checked to still
# start with the original bytes before it is pushed. The pipeline's evidence
# record in the PR body is never rewritten, truncated, or reordered.
#
# Idempotent: a body that already carries firstmate's marker comment or a magic
# word followed by the issue identifier is left alone, so running the PR check
# twice links exactly once. A bare identifier mention is not a Linear link.
