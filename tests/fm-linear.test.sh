# Behavior tests for the Linear mirror: the backlog parser (fm-backlog-tsv.sh),
# the PR linker (fm-linear-pr-link.sh) and its fm-pr-check.sh hook, and the
# in-place refresh (fm-linear-refresh.sh).
#
# The contract these pin, in priority order:
#   1. Linear NEVER gates delivery. Unconfigured, unreachable, unauthenticated,
#      slow, or simply missing an issue, the PR check still records the PR, arms
#      the merge poll, and exits 0.
#   2. The PR body edit is strictly additive and idempotent.
#   3. Refresh updates matched issues in place, creates only new ids, and only
#      REPORTS ids that left the backlog.
#
# The network is stubbed with a fakebin `curl` that answers per GraphQL
# operation name, so these stay hermetic: no ports, no server, deterministic in
# CI. jq stays the real tool. Live verification against the real Linear API is
# recorded in docs/linear.md.

# text, not shell expansions.
